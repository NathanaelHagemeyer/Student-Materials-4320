I was able to successfully set up an environment for testing, and I stumbled through
writing the first several tests, but I struggled with several issues.

First, I am only passingly familiar with Python, which while not an insurmountable obstacle,
did significantly slow me down. Second, I struggled to figure out how I (as a test writer)
was supposed to interface with the system. Some of the functions that seemed to me necessary
to test other functionality were subjects of tests, which seems problematic.

Ultimately, I'm not sure what the expected complexity of the tests is, or what assumptions
we can make, so I don't know if the tests that I have written are even close to what is
expected. For example, in what way am I supposed to access class data? Am I to assume that
the functions returning data are correct, or do I need to directly access the data stored
within classes? How much knowledge of the inner workings of the system should I even have?
Shouldn't that be a black box? I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to know / assume here.

I would really appreciate the provision of additional resources explaining how to write good
tests, preferably with some clear examples.
